== Database to RESTful Service Connector Lab

NOTE: This lab takes about an hour to complete. It covers topics you need to know to correctly complete the final assessment.

.Goals
* Create an API client connector to an external REST service, using a Swagger document
* Create an integration using this new API client connector and the PostgresDB connector, using Fuse Online
* Use a data mapper step to map fields between the PostgresDB schema and the external REST service schema

.Overview
CoolWater Inc. is a local water utility company that requires you to implement a payment management system that provides their clients with a convenient online water bill payment interface. The design of the integration involves capturing input from the To Do web application in a PostgreSQL database, which then initiates a REST API connection to a web service that displays the water bill payment details on the Payments Summary page of CoolWater Inc. In this lab, you implement this client use case that supports recurring billing for clients of CoolWater Inc.

== Create API Client Connector

Next, you create an API client connector using an existing Swagger document.

[NOTE]
A link:https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/[Swagger] document is a JSON object, developed with the link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md[OpenAPI Specification] in mind.
It serves as both a standards-based interface, as well as documentation, for a RESTful service. With the Swagger interface, minimal implementation logic needs to be generated in order to connect to RESTful services. This ease of use has led to the rapid adoption of Swagger in application development projects.

. In the left-hand panel of the Fuse Online console, select *Customizations*:
+
image::images/01-Step-04.png[]
