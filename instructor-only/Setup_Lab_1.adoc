== Introduction

You will set up the student lab environment consisting of CodeReady Studio, a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, common projects and middleware applications necessary for running the *Advanced Agile Integration lab*.

.Goal

* Provision an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to be used for the lab with the following applications:
** Red Hat 3scale API Management Multitenant Platform
** Red Hat 3scale Tenant API Managers and gateway
** Apicurito Studio
** Red Hat Fuse Online for each student user


== Deployment Architecture

The following diagram shows the high level deployment topology in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

== Software Installation

=== OpenShift Container Platform Cluster:

. Provision an OCP cluster using the Ansible playbook located in this subdirectory *./ansible/* of this current directory.
. The resulting OCP cluster is a:
* Lab-specific cluster
* Seeded with user1-100 identities
* Hosting 3scale, AMQ, Fuse on OpenShift and Fuse Online.
+
. Create the following variables in each student workstation:
+
.Environment Variables:
|=======================
  | Variable | Value | Remarks
  | REGION | TBD | GUID of the server to be provided.
  | OCP_DOMAIN |  $REGION.openshift.opentlc.com |
  | PROJECT_NAME_3SCALE | 3scale-mt-opentlc-mgr | Project for deploying multi-tenant Red Hat 3scale API Management (User: opentlc-mgr)
  | PROJECT_NAME_API | apicurito | Project for deploying common instance of Apicurito Studio (User: opentlc-mgr)
  | PROJECT_NAME_IGNITE | userX-fuse-online | Project for each user's individual Red Hat Fuse Online instance
|=======================
+
NOTE: Cluster Quota for secrets and service accounts needs to be configured based on the number of projects running in the cluster. A rough estimate is calculated by the following formula: 9 x number of Projects + any custom secrets.


=== Application Deployments on OpenShift

. The following installations must be completed as the user `userX` on the OpenShift Container Platform cluster, where is X is the unique number assigned to your ID.

. Login to OpenShift Container Platform as user 'userX' with the provided password.
+
----
$ oc login https://${OPENSHIFT_MASTER} -u opentlc-mgr
----
+
. The following applications need to be deployed to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Login as `opentlc-mgr` (user with admin access) to deploy.

==== Red Hat 3scale (Multi-tenant):

. Install a Red Hat 3scale Multi-tenant environment using this link:https://github.com/honghuac/rhsummit_ansible/tree/master/ansible/3scale_multitenant[Ansible Playbook]

. Examine the Ansible Playbook template
.. Note that it installs with multi-tenant deployment & creating tenants.
.. Each user gets own tenant for setting up APIs and the Red Hat 3scale Developer Portal.
.. The Red Hat 3scale API Management Platform is integrated with the Red Hat 3scale Developer Portal, using Red Hat SSO with OpenShift identity management.


==== Red Hat Fuse Online

. This can be installed using this link:https://github.com/honghuac/rhsummit_ansible/tree/master/ansible/fuse_online[Fuse Online Ansible Playbook]

. Install as many instances of Fuse Online as there are students (one per student)

. Examine the Ansible Playbook template
.. Note that it installs without multi-tenancy.
.. Each installation involves the use of a Syndesis operator that manages the installation.
.. In addition to the Fuse Online application pods, an AMQ Broker and a PHP app called `Todo` are also installed.


==== Red Hat Fuse On OpenShift and AMQ Online

. Import the Red Hat Fuse images and templates to the OpenShift Container Platform cluster, using this https://github.com/honghuac/rhsummit_ansible/tree/master/ansible/amq_fuse_templates_is[Ansible Playbook].
+
NOTE: The image streams available in the above template will need to be downloaded from `https://registry.redhat.io` which needs login access. Use the template created here instead: link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honghuac/rhsummit_ansible/master/json/fis-image-streams.json[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honghuac/rhsummit_ansible/master/json/fis-image-streams.json].


== Install Required Software on Student Workstations

In this setup lab, you create Red Hat Fuse on OpenShift applications, using Red Hat CodeReady Studio and OpenShift CLI tools on the desktop, and deploy them to an OpenShift project.

. Install the software listed here on your local machine:

* link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java SE^] (version 1.8)
