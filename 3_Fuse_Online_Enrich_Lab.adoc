= Lab 3 - Enrich Content and Aggregate Data on Red Hat Fuse Online Lab

While the previous lab focused on how developers can work with the application code and resources, _Coolstore Inc._ has an entire team of business users who want to be able to participate in the technologies surronding Agile Integration and offload some of the work from the development team. Fortunately, Fuse Online is an online offering that provides a easy to use interface to create integration solutions. 

In this lab, you will take on the role as a business user to develop an integration in link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/fuse-online[Red Hat Fuse Online] that process the account records in JSON format from the entperise AMQ broker and integrate with the existing integration to enrich and aggregate the content to create a more complete account record. The resulting record is stored in a database.

.Goals
* Design Red Hat Fuse Online Integration that consumes JSON records from Red Hat AMQ
* Enrich using backend REST service
* Enrich using backend SOAP service using the REST wrapper
* Map the responses from backend services to data fields
* Save the aggregated message in an SQL database

== Develop the Solution

Develop the solution by creating a new integration in the Red Hat Fuse Online console. Recall that all of the resources are deployed in the `fuse-online` project in OpenShift.

. Fuse Online provides a user interface for you to develop the integration. Locate the url of the route provided for the Fuse Online console from the
+
----
$ export FUSE_ONLINE_URL=https://$(oc get route -n fuse-online syndesis -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----
. Print out the URL for Fuse Online and navigate to the URL in a web browser
+
----
$ echo $FUSE_ONLINE_URL
----
. Login as `user1` using your OpenShift credentials
. Accept the self signed certificate and click `Allow` when presented to allow OpenShift and Fuse Online access to your credentials. Afterward, the Fuse Console will be displayed.

=== Extensions

Extensions are a mechanism to customize the functionality of Fuse Online. A custom extension is required to manage the headers for the request to backend APIs. Hence, add the following extension: link:https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-extensions/tree/master/syndesis-extension-manage-headers[https://github.com/syndesisio/syndesis-extensions/tree/master/syndesis-extension-manage-headers].

The extension is available in the lab assets location *$AI_EXERCISE_HOME/labs/lab03/extensions/syndesis-extension-manage-headers-1.0.0.jar*

. From the Fuse Online overview page, click *Customizatons* on the lefthand navigation bar and click *Extensions* on the top.
. Click the *Import Extension* button and navigate to the file location mentioned previously.

+
. Select Output type:
.. *Select Type*:  `JSON Schema`
.. *Definition*: Paste the following:
+
----
{"company":{"name":"Rotobots","geo":"NA","active":true},"contact":{"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"Smith","streetAddr":"100 N Park Ave.","city":"Phoenix","state":"AZ","zip":"85017","phone":"602-555-1100"}}
----
.. *Data Type Name*: Account
.. Select *Done*
+
image::images/lab-03/fuse-online-integration-2.png[]
+
. Choose a *Finish Connection* 
.. Select *UsecaseDB*

+
. Add a _Connection_ underneath the *RestEnrichAPI* connection
+
image::images/lab-03/fuse-online-integration-6.png[]
+
.. Select the *SoapEnrichAPI* connection.
.. In the _Choose an Action_ page, select *Enrich and Update a user account*.
. Add a *Step* before the *SoapEnrichAPI* connection.
+
image::images/lab-03/fuse-online-integration-7.png[]
+
.. Select *Data Mapper*

.. Select *Remove Header* 
.. Enter Header *Transfer-Encoding* into the textbox.
.. Click *Done*
+
NOTE: The *Transfer-Encoding* header is added by Camel during the call to REST service. This header will cause errors if passed to the subsequent SOAP service. Hence, the header needs to be removed before the next API call.
. Add a *Step* immediately after the *SoapEnrichService*.
.. Select *Log*
.. Check *Message Body*.
.. Insert `After SOAP Service` into *Custom Text*: .
.. Click Done
. Finally, add a *Step* immediately before the _Invoke SQL_ database connection.
.. Select *Data Mapper*
.. Define a new _Constant_ value by expanding *Constants* and selecting the *+* sign
.. Enter `fuse_online` into the textbox and confirm *String* as the _Value Type_
.. Click Done
.. Map the *fuse_online* Constant to the SQL Parameter *CREATION_USER*
.. Map the remaining values from the *Response* field in _Sources_ to the *SQL Parameter* on the _Target_
+
image::images/lab-03/fuse-online-integration-11.png[]
+
.. Click Done
. With all the _Steps_ and _Connections_ for the integrtation defined, select *Publish* on the top right
. Name the Integration *AMQToSQLEnrich*.
. Select *Publish* once again to complete the integration

The resulting integration should look as follows:

=== Publish and Test the Integration Module

Once an integration is published, a new image containing the integration is created. It will take a few minutes for the build to complete. Once complete, the resulting integration will appear as follows:

image::images/lab-03/fuse-online-integration-12.png[]

A new pod with the name starting with *i-amqtosqlenrich* is deployed in the `fuse-online` project and contains the integration that was created earlier.

Validate the integration by first sending a message to the `fuseOnlineAccountQueue` in the AMQ broker. 

. Retrieve the URL of the AMQ Message Broker. In a terminal window, type the following:
