== OpenShift Service Mesh - Lab

== Goals

In this lab, you will:

* Deploy microservice applications to OpenShift Service Mesh
* Visualize your OpenShift Service Mesh with Kiali
* Leverage Grafana to monitor your OpenShift Service Mesh
* Fault tolerance ...

== What is a Service Mesh?

As microservices-based applications become more prevalent, both the number of
and complexity of their interactions increases. Up until now much of the burden
of managing these complex microservices interactions has been placed on the
application developer, with different or non-existent support for microservice
concepts depending on language and framework.

The service mesh concept pushes this responsibility to the infrastructure, with
features for traffic management, distributed tracing and observability, policy
enforcement, and service/identity security, freeing the developer to focus on
business value. In this hands-on session you will learn how to apply some of
these features to a simple polyglot microservices application running on top of
OpenShift using Istio, an open platform to connect, manage, and secure
microservices.

== What is Istio?

https://istio.io/[Istio] is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. Istio
provides an easy way to create a network of deployed services with load
balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, and more, without
requiring any changes in application code. OpenShift can automatically inject a
special sidecar proxy throughout your environment to enable Istio management for
your application. This proxy intercepts all network communication between your
microservices microservices, and is configured and managed using Istio’s control
plane functionality -- not your application code!

== Kiali: Visualize the Service Mesh

At some point when you are developing your microservices architecture, you may want to visualize what is happening in your service mesh. You may have questions like “Which service is connected to which other service?” and “How much traffic goes to each microservice?” But because of the loosely tied nature of microservices architectures, these questions can be difficult to answer.

Those are the kinds of question that Kiali has the ability to answer—​by giving you a big picture of the mesh and showing the whole flow of your requests and data.

=== Explore Kiali

Kiali taps into the data provided by Istio and OpenShift Container Platform to generate its
visualizations. It fetches ingress data (such as request tracing with Jaeger),
the listing and data of the services, health indexes, and so on.

Kiali runs as a service together with Istio, and does not require any changes
to Istio or OpenShift Container Platform configuration (besides the ones required to install
Istio).

----
* Make note of the entry for `kiali`.

. Get the URL of the Kiali web console:
+
----
$ export KIALI_URL=https://$(oc get route kiali -n istio-system -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----

. Display the `KIALI_URL` URL:
+
----
$ echo $KIALI_URL
----

. Start a web browser on your computer and go to the URL for `$KIALI_URL`:
+
image::images/lab-05/kiali-login.png[]

. At the login screen, enter the default credentials:
* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `redhat`

. For a successful login, you will see the main Kiali screen.
+
image::images/lab-05/kiali-main-screen-start.png[width="100%"]

. At the moment, there none of the services have an istio sidecar associated with them. As a result, the services are not available in the service mesh. We'll cover that in a later section.

=== Update Security Context Constraints

. Update the Security Context Constraints (SCCs) by adding the service account to the `anyuid` and `privileged` SCCs in the `business_services` namespace:
+
----
$ export BUSINESS_SERVICES=business-services

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n $BUSINESS_SERVICES --as=system:admin

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n $BUSINESS_SERVICES --as=system:admin
----

=== Deploy Services into Service Mesh

. Edit the deployment config for the `rest-cxfrs-service`. 
+
----
$ oc edit deploymentconfig/rest-cxfrs-service
----

. Move to the line 46, you should see the following text
+
----
        fabric8.io/git-url: https://gitlab.com/redhatsummitlabs/agile-integration-for-the-enterprise.git
----

. Just after this line, add the following line
+
----
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true"
----

* When deploying an application into the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh you must opt in to injection by specifying the `sidecar.istio.io/inject` annotation with a value of true. Service Mesh relies on the existence of a proxy sidecar within the application’s pod to provide service mesh capabilities to the application.  Sidecar injection occurs at pod creation time.

. Save the deployment config file and exit the editor.

* By updating the deployment config, the old version of the pod is killed and a new one is created based on the updated deployment config. This new deployment config will inject the sidecar. As a result, we'll see two containers in the pods (1 for the application and 1 for the sidecar).


. Monitor the deployment of the pods:
+
----
$ oc get pods -w
----

. Wait until the Ready column displays `2/2` pods and the Status column displays `Running`:
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rest-cxfrs-service-6b576ffcf8-g6b48   2/2       Running   0          1m
----

. Press *Ctrl+C* to exit.

=== Generate Sample Data


To show the capabilities of Kiali, you need to generate some sample data. 

. Move back to your terminal window:
+
----
$ cd $AI_EXERCISE_HOME/code
----

. Retrieve the URL of the rest-cxfrs-service application:
+
----
$ export REST_CXFRS_URL=http://$(oc get route rest-cxfrs-service -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----

. Generate data:
+
----
$ script/run-all.sh
----

* Let this script continue to run.

=== View Service Graph

. Move back to the Kiali web console.

. In the left-hand panel, click *Graph*.

. From the *Namespace* list, select `business-services`.
+
image::images/lab-05/kiali-service-graph.png[width="100%"]

NOTE: It may take up to 3 minutes before the Kiali graph displays data.

* This page shows a graph with all of the microservices, connected by the requests going
through them. On this page you can see how the services interact with each
other, and you can zoom in or out.


=== View Animations in Service Graph

. On the *Graph* screen, click the *Display* list and check the *Traffic Animation* option:
+
image::images/lab-05/kiali-set-traffic-animation.png[]

* Expect to see traffic animation on the graph based on traffic that is generated by the `script/run-all.sh` script you started earlier:
+
image::images/lab-05/kiali-traffic-animation-base.png[]

=== Explore Service Listing

. In the left-hand panel, click *Services*.

* On the Services page you can view a listing of all the services that are running in the cluster, and
additional information about them such as health status.

. Observe that the *Namespace* list is set to `business-services`. This filters the list of services to just those for this tutorial namespace.
+
image::images/lab-05/kiali-service-list-2.png[width="100%"]

. Click the service to see its details:
+
image::images/lab-05/kiali-service-details.png[width="100%"]

* At the bottom, you can see the service's workloads, which display the pod(s).


== Grafana 

Out of the box, you also get additional monitoring with Grafana. 

https://grafana.com/[Grafana] is an open platform for data analysis and visualization. Grafana lets you create graphs and dashboards based on data from various monitoring systems, and it specializes in the display and analysis of this data. It is lightweight, easy to install, and it looks beautiful. In particular, Grafana supports querying Prometheus.

A simple dashboard, built using Grafana, is included with your Istio installation.

. Open a new terminal window

. Login to your OpenShift server:
+
----
$ oc login -u user1
----

* When prompted for password, enter: `r3dh4t1!`

. Set the Grafana URL using the the following command
+
----
$ export GRAFANA_URL=http://$(oc get route grafana -n istio-system -o template --template='{{.spec.host}}')
----

. View the GRAFANA_URL
+
----
$ echo $GRAFANA_URL
----

. Start a web browser on your computer and vist the URL for `GRAFANA_URL`
+
image::images/lab-05/grafana-home-start.png[width="100%"]

** The Grafana Istio dashboard gives you quick insight into how your system is doing. 

. On far left panel, select: *Dashboards > Manage*
+
image::images/lab-05/dashboards-manage.png[]

** You should see a list of dashboard folders.
+
image::images/lab-05/grafana-dashboards-list.png[width="100%"]

. Navigate to: *istio > Istio Mesh Dashboard*
+
image::images/lab-05/istio-mesh-dashboard.png[width="100%"]

** The information available on the Grafana dashboard includes a Dashboard Row with high-level metrics (e.g. Global Request Volume, success rates, 4xx errors), a Server Mesh view with charts for each service, and a Services row with details about each container for each service.


. From the list of services, select the `rest-cxfrs-service` service.
* This will show the detailed metrics for the `rest-cxfrs-service` service.

. Scroll down to the section labeled: *SERVICE WORKLOADS*
+
image::images/lab-05/grafana-cxfrs-service-details.png[width="100%"]

* This shows the number of incoming requests and related data. All of the incoming requests are generated by the script you ran earlier.
