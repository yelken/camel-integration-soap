In this lab, review the business use case for this Agile Enterprise technical workshop. Next, proceed to set up the environment for the labs in this course.


.Business Use Case

_Coolstore Inc._ is an ambitious e-commerce company that market quality consumer products on their portal. The company has bold plans in transforming itself into an link:https://www.cio.com/article/3269444/the-characteristics-of-an-agile-enterprise.html[*Agile Enterprise*]. At the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting/open-innovation-labs[*Red Hat Open Innovation Labs*] in Boston, _Coolstore Inc._ attended a link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting#GatedFormContainer[*discovery workshop*] organized by link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting[*Red Hat Consulting*], and documented their business priorities into a discovery paper.
The business priorities are simply: to improve _Coolstore Inc._ end-customer satisfaction levels, which will lead to increased sales and revenue.

_Coolstore Inc._'s key takeway from the discovery workshop was appreciating the compelling value proposition of the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration[*Red Hat Enterprise Integration strategy*] in helping enterprises become agile, which was clearly demonstrated by link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting[*Red Hat Consulting*].
As a result, the C-suite of _Coolstore Inc._ is firmly committed in adopting link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies[*Red Hat technologies*] as the fundamental infrastructure for their Agile Enterprise.

_Coolstore Inc_ insist on the highest availability and performance service level agreements (SLA) for their new Agile Integration infrastructure. That is why their technical staff has tested and chosen link:https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/[*Red OpenShift Container Platform*] to host and workload manage their containerized applications. Thanks to its reliability, scalability and performance, the product met the stringent SLAs set by _Coolstore Inc_. After all, link:https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/[*Red OpenShift Container Platform*] is powered by link:https://kubernetes.io/[*Kubernetes*] technology.

With the help of Red Hat, _Coolstore Inc._ has developed the following roadmap to achieving Enterprise Agility:

* Design Apache Camel routes, deployed on link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/fuse[*Red Hat Fuse*] that consume JSON records from link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq[*Red Hat AMQ*]
* Use the multicast EIP pattern to distribute the messages to the services
* Design the CXF web service using JAX-WS annotations to consume from SOAP backend service
* Consume data from the backend REST service
* Aggregate the messages received using the aggregation EIP pattern
* Save the aggregated message in an SQL database using the Spring SQL Camel component
* Use the Red Hat Fuse Tooling in Red Hat CodeReady Studio to create a *wsdl2rest* mapping
* Transform legacy SOAP-based services to more modern REST-based services using the *wsdl2rest* mapping
* Create a REST API layer on top of the Customer SOAP service
* Design an Apache Camel route that exposes REST API consuming JSON
* Implement JSON-based customer account record processing, with link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.2/html/fuse_on_openshift_guide/[*Fuse on OpenShift*] as the production environment
* Data enrichment and aggregation using REST services, to create customer account records stored in a database
* Design a hybrid-cloud-based integration solution, using link:https://www.openshift.com/products/fuse[*Fuse Online*], that consumes JSON records from link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq[*Red Hat AMQ*]
* Implement a REST-service interface for the cloud-based integration solution
* Enable service discovery in the cloud-based integration solution
* Integrate the cloud-based integration solution with a new API Management layer, built using link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/3scale/overview/[*3scale API Management*]
* Secure and manage API traffic routed to the integration solution through the link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/3scale/overview/[*3scale API Management*] Gateway
* Create Application Plan & Application in link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/3scale/overview/[*3scale API Management*]
* Deploy and test the solution end-to-end

As a second phase of their roadmap, _Coolstore Inc._ has plans to:

* Create an link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift_container_platform/[*Apache Kafka*] deployment using an Apache Kafka cluster operator
* Create an link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift_container_platform/[*Apache Kafka*] publisher and consumer for message delivery and retrieval
* Create an link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift_container_platform/[*Apache Kafka*] Connect deployment
* With a File connector and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.2/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift_container_platform/[*Apache Kafka*] Connect, implement a publishing mechanism for customer account records
* Enhance existing _Coolstore Inc._ portal using new Spring Boot applications, generated using link:https://launch.openshift.io[*Red Hat Developer Launcher*]
* Enable data persistence capabilities in the Spring Boot applications using Spring Data and JPA
* Deploy and test the Spring Boot applications on link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/application-runtimes[*Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes*]
