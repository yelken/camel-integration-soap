_Coolstore Inc._ is an ambitious e-commerce company that market quality consumer products on their portal. The company has bold plans in transforming itself into an link:https://www.cio.com/article/3269444/the-characteristics-of-an-agile-enterprise.html[*Agile Enterprise*]. At the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting/open-innovation-labs[*Red Hat Open Innovation Labs*] in Boston, _Coolstore Inc._ attended a link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting#GatedFormContainer[*discovery workshop*] organized by link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting[*Red Hat Consulting*], and documented their business priorities into a discovery paper.
The business priorities are simply: to improve _Coolstore Inc._ end-customer satisfaction levels, which will lead to increased sales and revenue.

_Coolstore Inc._'s key takeway from the discovery workshop was appreciating the compelling value proposition of the link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration[*Red Hat Enterprise Integration strategy*] in helping enterprises become agile, which was clearly demonstrated by link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting[*Red Hat Consulting*].
As a result, the C-suite of _Coolstore Inc._ is firmly committed in adopting link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies[*Red Hat technologies*] as the fundamental infrastructure for their Agile Enterprise.

_Coolstore Inc_ insist on the highest availability and performance service level agreements (SLA) for their new Agile Integration infrastructure. That is why their technical staff has tested and chosen link:https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/[*Red OpenShift Container Platform*] to host and workload manage their containerized applications. Thanks to its reliability, scalability and performance, the product met the stringent SLAs set by _Coolstore Inc_. After all, link:https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/[*Red OpenShift Container Platform*] is powered by link:https://kubernetes.io/[*Kubernetes*] technology.

With the help of Red Hat, _Coolstore Inc._ has envisioned implementing  the following items to achieving true Enterprise Agility:

* Design Apache Camel routes, deployed on link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/fuse[*Red Hat Fuse*] that consume JSON records from link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq[*Red Hat AMQ*]
* Use the multicast EIP pattern to distribute the messages to the services
* Design the CXF web service using JAX-WS annotations to consume from SOAP backend service
* Consume data from the backend REST service
* Aggregate the messages received using the aggregation EIP pattern
* Save the aggregated message in an SQL database using the Spring SQL Camel component
* Use the Red Hat Fuse Tooling in Red Hat CodeReady Studio to create a *wsdl2rest* mapping
* Transform legacy SOAP-based services to more modern REST-based services using the *wsdl2rest* mapping
* Create a REST API layer on top of the Customer SOAP service
* Design an Apache Camel route that exposes REST API consuming JSON
* Implement JSON-based customer account record processing, with link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.2/html/fuse_on_openshift_guide/[*Fuse on OpenShift*] as the production environment
* Data enrichment and aggregation using REST services, to create customer account records stored in a database
* Design a hybrid-cloud-based integration solution, using link:https://www.openshift.com/products/fuse[*Fuse Online*], that consumes JSON records from link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq[*Red Hat AMQ*]
* Implement a REST-service interface for the cloud-based integration solution
* Enable service discovery in the cloud-based integration solution
* Make use of a Service Mesh to reduce the need to include additional libraries into applications to account for common concerns with microservices apoplications.
* Deploy and test the solution end-to-end

== OpenShift Hosted Environment

A dedicated environemnt of the OpenShift Container Platform version 4 will be used throughout this workshop and each attendees is given their own dedicated cluster. 

=== Obtain a OpenShift Environment

Access to an environment is obtained by requesting a GUID which identifies a particular environment configuration for the workshop. 

. Navigate to the following *URL*: https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_summit
+
image::lab-01/guid-grabber-1.png[width="70%"]

. Enter the following values in the form
.. Lab Code: *TE5CC2 - Agile Integration for the Enterprise*
.. Activation Key: *<Instructors will provide>*
.. Email Address: *Your Email Address*
. Click *Submit*

A unique _GUID_ will be obtained and a page containing the environment details will be displayed. On this page, you will find links to access the OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI) and the OpenShift Web Console.

image::lab-01/guid-grabber-2.png[width="70%"]

== Login to OpenShift Container Platform

Let's login to both the OpenShift web console and to the CLI using the information provided in the previous section. 

Credentials for OpenShift are as follows:

* Username*: `user1`
* Password*: `r3dh4t1!`

=== Login to the OpenShift Web Console

. On the environment information page, you will see a link for the OpenShift Web Console. It will be in the format *https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-GUID.DOMAIN*
+
image::lab-01/openshift-web-console-login.png[width="70%"]

. Click on the link provided and login using the provided credentials and when successful, the console will be displayed.
+
image::lab-01/openshift-web-console.png[width="70%"]


=== Login to the OpenShift Command Line Interface

Many of the operations that will be performed during this workshop will make use of the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). On the environment request page, you will see a link for API access. This is the resource used by the CLI and in the format *https://api.cluster-GUID.DOMAIN:6443*. This value will be referred to as `OPENSHIFT_API` in subsequent steps.

The laptop for which you are using has the OpenShift executable for both version 3 and 4 in the `~/bin` folder. Since version 4 is being utilized in this workshop, create a symbolic link to the `ocp4` binary by executing the following command:

----
$ ln -s ~/bin/ocp4 ~/bin/oc
----

You will now be able to use `oc` and have the command execute the correct binary.

Now, let's login to OpenShift

. Login to OpenShift Container Platform as user `user1` with the password provided above.
+
----
$ oc login ${OPENSHIFT_API} -u user1
----

. Enter the password when prompted. 

A response similar to the following indicates successful authentication to the CLI:

----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * business-services
    enterprise-services
    fuse-online
    istio-system

Using project "business-services".

----

=== OpenShift Project Layout

The OpenShhift environment has been preconfigured for this workshop. When you logged in to OpenShift, you were presented with a list of projects that are available to you. A _project_ in OpenShift is a workspace for which you and potentially others can collaborate. 

The following table describes the OpenShift projects and their purpose:

[cols="1,1", options="header"] 
.OpenShift Projects
|===
|Name
|Description

|`business-services`
|Location in which microservices applications developed as part of this workshop will reside

|`enterprise-services`
|Contains shared resources, such as Red Hat AMQ 7 and PostgreSQL

|`fuse-online`
|Resources related to Fuse Online

|`istio-system`
|Core components for the Red Hat Service Mesh
|===

=== Explore OpenShift Projects

Let's take a moment and explore the contents of each project.

. Explore the set enterprise resources that are deployed in the `enterprise-services` project. These include Red Hat AMQ 7 and a PostgreSQL relational database. The database has also already been preconfigured for use in the exercises with the proper schema and tabls.
+
----
$ oc get pods -n enterprise-services
----
+
. Explore the contents of the `fuse-online` project. The upstream project for Red Hat Fuse Online is called link:https://syndesis.io/[Syndesis]. Many of the assets contained in the deployment of Fuse Online will use this name.
+
----
$ oc get pods -n fuse-online
----
+
. Explore the contents of the `istio-system` project. This project contains all of the resources related to the Red Hat Service Mesh.
+
----
$ oc get pods -n istio-system
----
+
. Finally, the `business-servives` project will be used to deploy all of the microservices applications thoughout this workshot. Do not worry that no resources are found currently. This project is empty, but will start to be populated in the next lab.

== Explore Red Hat CodeReady Studio

Red Hat CodeReady Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that combines both tooling and runtime components, including Eclipse plug-ins, best-of-breed open source tools, and the Red Hat(R) JBoss(R) Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP).
